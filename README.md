# python_api_challenge

Part 1: WeatherPy
In this deliverable, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. I used the citipy Python libraryLinks and the OpenWeatherMap APILinks  to create a representative model of weather across cities. I examined the follwoing possible relationships:

Latitude vs. Temperature

Latitude vs. Humidity

Latitude vs. Cloudiness

Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Using linear regression, I found that there was a moderate to strong relationship between latitude and temperature and a weak to no relationship between the other factors.

Part 2: VacationPy
In this deliverable, I used my weather data skills to plan future vacations. The tools used were Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API. I created a map showing location and humidity of a lrage number of citites. I filtered the data to only include citties within a comfortable temperature and humidity range. I then used the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10km of the coordinates of the citites chosen above. Finally I plotted a map of the selected citites including the hotel name and country information in the hoverpoint.
